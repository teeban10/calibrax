- Helped with planning, further understanding and breakdown of the challenge. Helped identify flaws in my thinking or plans.
- Helped with DB Schema and prompts to give to cursor
- Helped with some architectural decisions


Cursor (Opus & Auto)

- Build UI and some bug fixing
- Execute or planning for buil features

Backend Architecture

- PG 
- Express
- Drizzle ORM
- Schema and aggregation (DB_SCHEMA.md)
- Other stack considered
  - Python FastAPI
  - MongoDB
  - Prisma

Scope and Prioritization

- So far the frontend only shows overprcing across competitors and pricing products across vendors and competitors
- Ingestion and Showing parsed tabular data will be the next stage since they are not exactly the key part. Main objective is the analysis

Issues Discovered

- No categories column on CSV
- Pricing not normalized according a uniform unit.


User Experience

- System is designed for analysts who or vendors maybe even SME who wants a way to improve pricing

What to build next:

Scraping products and parsing ourself
Using LLM to answer queries related to pricing or statistics
Using LLM to parse certain datas
